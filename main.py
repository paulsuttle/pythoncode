#Generally speaking, a statement is a unit of execution, and an expression is a unit of evaluation. In Python, an expression is any combination of literals, identifiers, and operators.

#CLASSES
#https://realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/
#everything is an object in Python, and a class is how an object is defined - A class is a blueprint for how something should be defined - It doesnâ€™t actually contain any data.  Python class names are written in CapitalizedWords notation by convention
#An instance of a CLASS is called an OBJECT/ an "instance" is an OBJECT that is built from a CLASS and contains real data. Objects are created by calling the Class like a function ("objectname=ClassName()")
#functions associated with a Class are called Methods, this provide the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.
#We have data in the form of variables, and methods in the form of  function definitions. You'll notice that the first parameter of a METHOD is always self. Self is not a keyword, but it's used by convention. SELF refers to a specific OBJECT, not the CLASS itself
